## 🛑 Two-way Table Blind Spot: Failed to distinguish between "Global Total" and "Conditional Group Total."
* **Strategy**: Circle the denominator (the "of" part of the sentence) before looking at the numerator.

### 🛑 1/21 Trap: The "Proportion vs. Absolute Count" Illusion
> **Lesson**: A higher percentage does NOT mean a higher number of people.

* **The Mistake**: Selecting an answer about "more people" (Absolute Count) based solely on a "Relative Frequency Table" (Proportion).
* **Structural Logic**: 
    * **Relative Frequency** (e.g., 0.15 vs 0.08) describes the **Shape** or density within a group.
    * **Absolute Count** depends on the **Scale** (the total sample size $N$ of that group).
* **The Golden Rule**: Unless the total $N$ for each group is provided, any conclusion claiming "more/fewer people" is logically invalid. 
* **PhD Research Mantra**: In my future YOPD data analysis, I must distinguish between the *prevalence rate* (percentage) and the *patient population size* (absolute count) to avoid misleading policy conclusions.

## 🛑 The "Static vs. Dynamic" Barrier
* **The Struggle**: Moving from the architectural "Fixed Beam" mindset ($y = kx + b$) to the "Dynamic Flow" of parametric equations ($\vec{x} = \vec{a} + t\vec{v}$).
* **Mental Block**: Initially viewing a vector as a static arrow rather than a **movement command**.
* **Breakthrough**: Realizing that the vector $\vec{a}$'s "head" is merely the starting camp, and $t$ is the "throttle" pushing the point along the guide rail.



---

## 🛑 The "Limit vs. Reality" Paradox
* **The Struggle**: Accepting that a function can have a limit at a point where it is technically "undefined" or "broken".
* **Mental Block**: The $x=7$ trap—getting distracted by a "displaced point" (outlier) and missing the convergence of the neighborhood.
* **Breakthrough**: Internalizing the "Neighbor Rule"—Limits are about the **collective dream** of the surrounding points, regardless of where the individual point actually stands.

## 🛑 The "Semantic Translation" Fatigue
* **The Struggle**: Statistics feeling like a "Liberal Arts" subject due to heavy word-play.
* **Mental Block**: Spending 20 minutes on only 3 problems because of complex phrasing like "at least" or "not exceeding".
* **Breakthrough**: Shifting from "Calculating" to "Modeling." Accepting that the 20-minute struggle is actually the process of **defining the boundary conditions** for a economic model.

---

## 🛑 Wave Intuition & The Derivative "Lead"
* **The Struggle**: Understanding why derivatives feel like they "predict" the future.
* **Mental Block**: Grasping the $1/4$ cycle phase lead between Sine and Cosine waves.
* **Breakthrough**: Seeing the derivative not just as a slope, but as a **velocity vector** that tells you where the wave *intends* to be in the next moment.

## 🛠 Lessons for Kobe University (GSICS)
1.  **Don't trust visual intuition alone**: Graphs can lie (like $x=7$); always verify with the Left-Hand vs. Right-Hand limit logic.
2.  **Embrace the "40-minute contemplation"**: Deep thought after a video is where the structural change in the brain happens.
3.  **Data as Vectors**: In Econometrics, variables (GDP, Health access, Labor) are just vectors "spanning" a space of possibilities.

**"The 40 minutes of thinking that felt like it would 'take my life' was actually the sound of my brain re-wiring itself."**
