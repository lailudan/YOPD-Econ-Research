# Marginal and conditional distributions

#### 1. Marginal Distribution: The "Outer Perimeter" (边缘分布)
* **Definition**: The distribution of a single variable, ignoring all other categories.
* **Mental Model**: The "Elevation View" of a building. You don't see the internal partitions; you only see the total silhouette.
* **Mathematical Key**: 
    * **Denominator**: Always the **Grand Total** (the bottom-right corner).
    * **Focus**: What is the overall percentage of "Neck Repairs" in the entire dataset?

#### 2. Conditional Distribution: The "Internal Layout" (条件分布)
* **Definition**: The distribution of one variable *within* a specific subset of another variable.
* **Mental Model**: Opening a specific "Room" door. Your entire universe is now limited to that room's inhabitants.
* **Mathematical Key**:
    * **Denominator**: The **Row Total** or **Column Total** of the specific category you are "Given".
    * **Trigger Words**: Look for "Of those...", "If...", or "Given that...".

#### 3. Strategic Summary for PhD Research
* **Marginal**: Tells me the **Scale** of a problem (e.g., Total % of YOPD patients in Japan).
* **Conditional**: Tells me the **Risk Factors** or **Associations** (e.g., % of YOPD patients who are also architects).






# Study Notes: Quantitative Logic Transition
**Timeline:** Jan 11 - Jan 20, 2026  
**Mission:** Bridging the gap between Architectural Static Equilibrium and Econometric Dynamic Evolution.

## 1. Statistics: The "Liberal Arts" of Mathematics
> **Core Insight:** Statistics is more about precise semantic translation than rote calculation. It is the art of describing uncertainty with honesty.

* **Frequency Tables**: Mastering the "subtraction logic" to determine interval counts—essential for cleaning messy health datasets.
* **Semantic Traps**: Understanding how phrases like "at least" or "no more than" define the strict boundaries of a set.
* **Research Application**: This forms the foundation for processing YOPD labor market data, where the definition of a "shock" depends on precise boundary conditions.

## 2. Calculus: The Philosophy of Limits
> **Core Insight:** Limits care about where your "neighbors" are going, not where "you" are. It is the study of convergence.

* **The Rule of Convergence**: A limit exists ($L$) if and only if the path from the left equals the path from the right:
  $$\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) = L$$
* **Discontinuity & The $x=7$ Realization**:
    * **Jump Discontinuity**: Left and right paths lead to different goals; no consensus exists.
    * **Removable Discontinuity**: A "hole" exists, but the paths converge. This taught me to distinguish between **path convergence** and **point reality**—a vital skill for identifying data outliers.

## 3. Linear Algebra: Parametric Vector Thinking
> **Core Insight:** A vector equation is a dynamic "action command" consisting of Position + Offset.

* **The Anchor ($\vec{a}$)**: The position vector—the "structural foundation."
* **The Direction ($\vec{b} - \vec{a}$)**: The guide rail for the line's orientation.
* **The Parameter ($t$)**: The "momentum" that scales the direction:
  $$\vec{L}(t) = \vec{a} + t(\vec{v})$$
* **The Concept of "Span"**:
    * **1D Span**: One vector and one parameter create a line.
    * **2D Span**: Two non-parallel vectors create a plane (the "floor plate" of a data space).


---

## 4. Cross-Disciplinary Synthesis
* **Static vs. Dynamic**: Transitioning from the Static Equilibrium of Architecture ($\sum F = 0$) to the Dynamic Evolution of Economics.
* **Predictive Intuition**: Recognizing that derivatives represent "trends"—how the lead in a Sine/Cosine wave predicts the next movement of the system.

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking
* **Daily Streak**: 10 consecutive days (2026.01.11 - 2026.01.20).
* **Current State**: Successfully bridged the gap between $y = kx + b$ (static) and $\vec{x} = \vec{a} + t\vec{v}$ (dynamic).
* **Upcoming Goal**: Deep dive into the "Span" of multiple vectors and the Master-to-PhD pipeline at Kobe University.
