# HEOR-Econ-Research
In a world of noise, math provides the only certainty. I use GitHub to track the entropy reduction of my own understanding of YOPD/YOAD.

# HEOR-Econ-Research: Health Economics & Outcomes Research

This repository documents the academic transition and research progress from **Architecture** to **Econometrics and Health Economics**. It serves as a centralized hub for the mathematical foundations, physics-based mental models, and empirical implementation of my research in Disability Economics.

## 🏛 Research Vision
Guided by the upcoming **Master-PhD pipeline (2026)** at **Kobe University** under **Professor Shingo Takahashi**, this research focuses on the intersection of chronic health conditions—specifically **Young-Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD)**—and their impact on labor market outcomes, human capital depreciation, and social policy.
